# Open Visual WebUI
Open Visual WebUI is an open-source, browser-based interface for real-time video and image processing. It provides a clean, modern web UI to stream video from your webcam or process uploaded files, with the flexibility to integrate multiple computer vision algorithms such as object detection, tracking, super-resolution, and face restoration.
